# Heart_disease_prediction

So using a dataset i found on kaggle , link
dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

I built a classification model to predict a heart disease based on the person's data :

ageage in years
sex(1 = male; 0 = female)
cpchest pain type
trestbpsresting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
cholserum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs(fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecgresting electrocardiographic results
thalachmaximum heart rate achieved
exangexercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeakST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slopethe slope of the peak exercise ST segment
canumber of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
