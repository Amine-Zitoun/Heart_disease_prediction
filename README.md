# Heart_disease_prediction

So using a dataset i found on kaggle , link
dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

I built a classification model to predict a heart disease based on the person's data :<br>

ageage in years <br>
sex(1 = male; 0 = female) <br>
cpchest pain type <br>
trestbpsresting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)<br>
cholserum cholestoral in mg/dl<br>
fbs(fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)<br>
restecgresting electrocardiographic results<br>
thalachmaximum heart rate achieved<br>
exangexercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)<br>
oldpeakST depression induced by exercise relative to rest<br>
slopethe slope of the peak exercise ST segment<br>
canumber of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy<br>
thal3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect<br>
